## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?
I have learned to break down large tasks into smaller, manageable parts. Instead of waiting until the due date to start an assignment, I now plan out my work earlier.


## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I still need to improve my consistency in dedicating focused study time each week. 

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Iâ€™ve been actively engaging with feedback from practicals and improving my code accordingly.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

 I need to better document my code for clarity, especially when reviewing it later.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I would appreciate more real-world mini-projects that simulate how developers work in industry.
