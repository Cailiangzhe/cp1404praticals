## About This Repository

This repository contains my practical programming work for [CP1404 - Programming II](https://github.com/CP1404).  
It includes weekly exercises and tasks to help improve my Python skills and understanding of object-oriented programming.

### About Me

I am a student of James Cook University, passionate about software development and improving my coding practices.  
These practicals have helped me grow in writing clean, readable, and efficient Python code.

##  Lessons Learned About Clean Code

- Use **meaningful variable and function names** to improve code readability.
- Follow **consistent formatting** (e.g., indentation, spacing) and use tools like **"Reformat Code"** in PyCharm.
- Keep functions **short and single-purpose**, following the "one thing well" principle.
- Use **docstrings and comments** effectively to explain what your code does and why.
- Organize code using **classes and modules** appropriately, embracing **encapsulation**.
